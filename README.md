# Employee-Management-System
Employee Management System Using JDBC and Oracle Database.

This mini project entails the development of an Employee Management System utilizing Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) with an Oracle Database. The system will provide a comprehensive solution for managing employee records efficiently. The key functionalities of the system include:

1. Add Employee: Allows the addition of new employee records to the database, capturing essential details such as name, position, department, and salary.

2. Search Employee: Facilitates searching for specific employees based on various criteria like employee ID, name, or department to retrieve detailed information.

3. View All Employees: Provides the capability to view a list of all employees currently in the database, displaying pertinent information in a structured format.

4. Update Employee: Enables the modification of existing employee records, allowing updates to details such as job title, department, or salary.

5. Delete Employee: Permits the removal of employee records from the database, ensuring that obsolete or incorrect information can be efficiently managed.

This project will employ JDBC to establish a connection between the Java application and the Oracle Database, ensuring seamless data operations and integrity.
